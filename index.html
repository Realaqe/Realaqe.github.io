<p>
  I am a Ph.D. candidate in the William H. Miller III Department of Physics & Astronomy at 
  Johns Hopkins University, advised by Dr. Timothy Brandt at STScI and Prof. Kevin Schlaufman. 
  I study the detection and characterization of substellar objects by combining precision 
  astrometry, radial-velocity measurements, and direct-imaging data. My work contributed to observing programs such as 
  NASA Keck SMS and the SCExAO Direct Imaging Survey, and involved processing data from Gaia, 
  Hipparcos, and ground-based AO systems.   Before JHU, I completed my M.A. in Physics at the University of California, Santa Barbara in 2024, 
  where I worked with Dr. Timothy Brandt on identifying and characterizing substellar companions. 
</p>

<p>
  I earned my B.S. degrees in Engineering Physics and in Mathematics & Astronomy from the 
  University of Illinois Urbana–Champaign in December 2020, graduating with Highest Honors. 
  My early research was in condensed-matter experiment and biophysics computation, including a 
  2023 publication on the channel capacity of the ribosome.

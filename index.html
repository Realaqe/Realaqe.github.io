        <h1><strong>Qier</strong> An</h1>

<p>
  I earned my B.S. degrees in Engineering Physics and in Mathematics & Astronomy from the 
  University of Illinois Urbana–Champaign (UIUC) in December 2020, graduating with Highest Honors. 
  At UIUC, my research focused on condensed-matter experiment and biophysics computation, 
  where I co-authored a 2023 publication on the channel capacity of the ribosome. These early 
  experiences shaped my interest in quantitative methods and instrumentation, which later guided 
  my transition toward exoplanet studies.
</p>

<p>
  I completed my M.A. in Physics at the University of California, Santa Barbara in 2024 under the 
  guidance of Dr. Timothy Brandt. At UCSB, I worked extensively on the detection and characterization 
  of substellar companions using astrometry, radial velocities, and direct imaging. My research 
  contributed to multi-instrument observing programs—including NASA Keck Strategic Mission Support 
  and the SCExAO Direct Imaging Survey—and I gained experience processing data from both ground-based 
  extreme adaptive optics systems and space-based missions such as Gaia and Hipparcos. I also served 
  as a teaching assistant for a range of physics and astronomy courses.
</p>

<p>
  I am now a Ph.D. candidate in the William H. Miller III Department of Physics & Astronomy at 
  Johns Hopkins University, advised by Dr. Timothy Brandt at STScI and Prof. Kevin Schlaufman. 
  My research focuses on the detection and characterization of substellar objects by combining 
  high-precision astrometry, radial-velocity measurements, and direct-imaging data. Broadly, I am 
  interested in understanding the formation, evolution, and demographics of substellar objects.
